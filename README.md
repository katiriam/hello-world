Hello humans!

My name is Katie and I'm learning how to code. Why? There are zero reasons behind this.
I think it is because I'm the secretary of a bunch of programmers, and I want to be part of their conversations and understand when they do their "code-talk".
I'm an English High School teacher and my dream is to become a college professor one day.
Oh, I'm also obsessed with coffee :)
